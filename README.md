## FAQ (Q&A)

> ### What should we call you?
I go by Shaman online. I made a Transformice account and made the "nickname" something easy to remember because I didn't realize that the nickname was actually the screen name. At first it was "silly" with 5 L's. (sillllly, if you want to look for it.)  So my second account was named "Imaproshaman" because 12 year old me thought that people would know I was "good at the game by default". I’ve been playing since the 16th of June, 2011.

> ### How old are you and where are you from?
February 10th, 1999. Oregon, US.

> ### Is that what your voice "actually" sounds like/are you a girl?
I’m just me. I go by they/them pronouns.

> ### When did you start streaming?
I streamed as far back as somewhere around early/pre-2016, started actively streaming from around 2018. What I always tell people is, if I enjoy playing, then someone might enjoy watching. Streams are really whenever and for however long. I don't take it very seriously. If I force myself to do it and adhere to a schedule, then it would feel like a job. That's not very fun for me.

> ### Why did you start speedrunning?
Casually, I’ve been replaying games since I was a kid since I rarely got new games except on special occasions, like a birthday or a holiday. So I just played what I had. Around the latter half of 2017, I joined the [Mirror’s Edge Catalyst Speedrunning Discord server][url-mec] after being referred to it by a friend, [SteveGlowPlunk][url-steveglowplunk]. Then I bought the game Refunct on Steam and had 100% the achievements. They added some more and one of them required beating the game under 4 minutes, which meant that I had to learn the basic Any% route. I loved how fun it was so I kept doing it.

> ### I have an osu! related question?
Everything about me relating to osu!, including my setup, can be found on [my profile][url-osu].

> ### Why don’t you speedrun/play X/why are you doing X thing Y way?
There’s probably a reason for it but I’ll try my best to answer it if you ask.

> ### What’s your opinion on/favorite X?
Feel free to ask anything like this but expect a passionately detailed response to any of these kinds of questions.

> ### Why don’t you have facecam?
It isn’t necessary for the enjoyment of my content and I don't want to show myself like that. I can list several examples of successful streamers who don’t even use it. I'm okay with showing a handcam though and I think more people should. Especially for rhythm games and speedrunning. I always think those are really interesting.

> ### What marathons have you been a part of?
